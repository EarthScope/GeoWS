h2. "GeoWS Service Template":GeoWS-Service-Template.pdf

The Service Template specifies guidelines and commonalities and guidelines defining behavior and presentation of a GeoWS web service interface.  Most GeoWS-style web services are expected to offer functionality beyond what is specified in this document, such as domain-specific formats, data-specific parameters, organization-specific context-paths, etc.

h2. "GeoCSV":https://github.com/EarthScope/GeoCSV - Tabular text formatting for geoscience data

The GeoCSV format is a dialect of the model developed by the W3C's "CSV on the Web Working Group":http://www.w3.org/2013/csvw/wiki/Main_Page.

The headers allow for common metadata to be included with a tabular text dataset and the specification is extensible, allowing for domain-specific headers to be added as needed.  The defined annotations are designed for use as additions to exisiting text data or new structured text data.
